# CSS
This repositoy will hold all the CSS files I have made, found useful, and would like to share.


# Spacing file
This is a small (6.5 KB normal, 5.3 minified) css file that let you add padding or margins to elements easly using the rem values and a very simple and logical syntax. For example:
 
 `<div class="has-padding-right-1"></div>`

This adds 1rem of padding to the top of the element. You can replace the "padding" with "margin", "right" with [bottom, left, top], and "1" with 0.5 or a positive integer 1-20.
